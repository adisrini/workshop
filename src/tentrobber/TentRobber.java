/**
 * You are a robber planning on making a round of robberies of tents in K-Ville.
 * 
 * Thanks to some scouting you've done prior, each tent has a certain value known to you, and you'd like to maximize the total value of your robberies.
 * 
 * You can rob multiple tents, but the only constraint stopping you from robbing all of them is that tents have thin walls, and robbing a tent automatically alerts adjacent tents and campus police will get notified.
 * 
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the value of robbing each tent, determine the tents you should rob to maximize your earnings without being caught by police.
